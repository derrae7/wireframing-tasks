# Wireframing Tasks

> Replicate the reference images in each of the `task` folders using HTML & CSS

### Goal

The goal is to replicate the reference images in each of the `task` folders using HTML and CSS.

All `task` folders have an `index.html` page and a `style.css` file which is already linked in the HTML, so you can start adding stuff to either file and changes will be good to go once you save and refresh.

### Notes

I added in a `reset.css` file, which is just a stylesheet that resets all the default browser styles so that you'll have to do all the styling yourself. So, e.g., `h1` and `p` tags will look the same.
